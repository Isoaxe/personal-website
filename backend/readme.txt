A note on setting up the back-end:

To get started, run "npm install" from this folder in terminal. This will install all of the required node modules and generate the package-lock.json file. These are all auto-generated on these commands and thus have not been included in the GitHub repo.

After this, run the script "npm start" to spin up a local development server. This script will also restart the server when any changes to the backend .js and .json files have been made.
